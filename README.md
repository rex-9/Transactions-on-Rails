# Transactions on Rails

> The mobile web application where users can manage their budget: users have a list of transactions associated with a category so that the owner can see how much money they spent and on what.

This Ruby on Rails application allows the user to:
- register and log in, so that the data is private to them.
- introduce new transactions associated with a category.
- see the money spent on each category.
